## Challenges Faced:

- We faced a couple of challenges while building this project, the major one was integrating the newly released Thirdweb Wallet SDK.
- We also faced challenges in making the website NFT Gated, as we tried to add some backend with Solidity, but failed in integrating it with Frontend.

## Future Plans:

- We will be using this frontend with some changes for the ongoing Hedera hackathon
